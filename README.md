# Nuclophosmin role in colorectal cancer
This code was used to analyse Riboseq from a murine colorectal cancer model upon depletion of Nucleophosmin.

The results have been published in the manuscript titled "Nucleophosmin supports WNT-driven hyperproliferation and tumour initiation" (DOI here)

The basis of all analysis are the scripts in the main Riboseq branch of the [Bushell lab](https://github.com/Bushell-lab/Ribo-seq), developed by Dr. Joseph Waldron, Associate Scientist in the lab of Martin Bushell at CRUK Scotland Institute.

The pause site analysis script was written by Dr. Pauline Herviou, Postdoctoral Scientist in the lab of Martin Bushell at CRUK Scotland Institute.

## Environments
The analysis is done within specific envirnments as described in the [Riboseq pipeline installation page](https://github.com/Bushell-lab/Ribo-seq/tree/main/Installation)

The exact composition of the environment used for these analysis is in the Riboseq_environment.yml and RNAseq_environment.yml files in the Environment subfolder
