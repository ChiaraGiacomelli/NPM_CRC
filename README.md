This code was used to analyse Riboseq from a murine colorectal cancer model upon depletion of Nucleophosmin.

The results have been published in the manuscript titled "Nucleophosmin supports WNT-driven hyperproliferation and tumour initiation" (DOI here)

The basis of all analysis are the scripts in the main Riboseq branch of the Bushell lab (here link), developed by Dr. Joseph Waldron, Associate Scientist in the lab of Martin Bushell at CRUK Scotland Institute.

The pause site analysis script was written by Dr. Pauline Herviou, Postdoctoral Scientist in the lab of Martin Bushell at CRUK Scotland Institute.
