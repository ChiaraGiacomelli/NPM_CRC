# Metagene plots and pause analyses
These scripts have been used to look at RPFs distribution across transcripts and to identify pauses

In Metagene_plots are the scripts to calculate the positional data and to plot Figs 4h and Extended Fig 8v.
In Pause_analyses are the scripts to calculate the pauses and their delta upon Npm1 KO. As well, scripts for plots 4f and 4g.

## Dependencies within subfolders
It is required to run the script **normalise individual transcript counts** inside metagene_plots in order to get the counts_list.Rdata which is required for the pause analysis script.
